# Science Fiction

Science fiction (abbreviated SF or sci-fi with varying punctuation and capitalization) is a broad genre of fiction that often involves
speculations based on current or future science or technology. Science fiction is found in books, art, television, films, games, theatre, and other media. 
In organizational or marketing contexts, science fiction can be synonymous with the broader definition of speculative fiction,
encompassing creative works incorporating imaginative elements not found in contemporary reality; this includes fantasy, horror and related genres.

Although the two genres are often conflated as science fiction/fantasy, science fiction differs from fantasy in that,
within the context of the story, its imaginary elements are largely possible within scientifically established or
scientifically postulated laws of nature (though some elements in a story might still be pure imaginative speculation).
Exploring the consequences of such differences is the traditional purpose of science fiction, making it a "literature of ideas". 
Science fantasy is largely based on writing entertainingly and rationally about alternate possibilities in settings that are contrary to known reality.
